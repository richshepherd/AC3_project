# Climate Data Analysis

This repository contains scripts to download, preprocess, and analyze climate data from HadCRUT5 and ERA5 datasets. The scripts will generate GIFs showing monthly evolution and winter mean temperature anomalies.

## Contents

- `HadCRUT5/`: Directory for HadCRUT5 data files.
- `ERA5/`: Directory for ERA5 data files.
- `scripts/`: Directory for all scripts used in this analysis.
  - `download_and_preprocess.sh`: Bash script to download and preprocess the data.
  - `create_gifs.py`: Python script to create GIFs from the processed data.
- `README.md`: This file, containing instructions and explanations.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies.

## Prerequisites

To run these scripts, you need the following software installed:

- **Git**: Version control system to clone the repository.
- **Conda**: Package manager to create and manage environments (recommended).
- **CDO**: Climate data operators for data processing.
- **Imagemagick**: To create GIFs from the images.

### Install Git

Follow the instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to install Git. Github on the web is also sufficient and can be assessed [here](https://github.com/login).

### Install Conda

Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) to install Conda. Here you could select `Miniconda` which is a stand-alone python distribution for conda or `Anaconda` which is a more robust data analysis software manager. Anaconda manages different sofware that are useful for analysis and sofware development.

### Create a new environment with required packages
Open a terminal and run the following command to create a new environment and install all needed packages

```
conda create --yes --name new_environment python=3.9 \matplotlib pandas glob pillow numpy pip
```


### Install CDO

Follow the instructions [here](https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/projects/cdo/wiki) to install CDO.

### Install ImageMagick

Follow the instructions [here](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php) to install ImageMagick. As an alternative to ImageMagick, Pillow has also been included in the list of packages that will be installed along with conda.

## Cloning the Repository

Open a terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:
```git clone git@github.com:richshepherd/AC3_project.git```
